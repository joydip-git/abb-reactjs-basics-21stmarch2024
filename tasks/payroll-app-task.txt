create an application to calculate salary of employees

developer:
	attributes: name, id, basicpay, dapay, hrapay, incentivepay
	method: calculateSalary
				args: NA
				return: calculated salary

hr:
	attributes: name, id, basicpay, dapay, hrapay, gratuitypay
	method: calculateSalary
				args: NA
				return: calculated salary

finally,
	you need to create at least two instances (one of each type) of dev and hr (using hard-coded data)
	store them in an array
	iterate through the array and then calculate salary of every employee and print the same
